# About Me
I have a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Currently I'm making transition towards datascience because of following reasons 
  1. It has maths ( which is covered in engineering)
  2. It has programming ( currently learning)
  3. Get to ask question in every stage of the project.
  4. making me a better problem solver in life.
